Objective: Implement different ML frameworks to predict solubility and build molecular descriptors. Methods covered include:
- linear regression and gradient descent
- logistic regression
- neural networks
- graph convolution neural networks (GCNN)
  - the more layers you add, you can learn about neightbors of your neighbor, i.e. atom 'feels' atoms further away
